# Color Interval Controller
A vanilla JavaScript project showcasing the implementation and control of the setInterval() and clearInterval() timing functions to create a dynamic background color effect.

ðŸš€ Features
Random Color Generation: A function to reliably generate a valid 6-digit hexadecimal color code (#RRGGBB).

Start/Stop Control: Users can start the color cycling with the "Start" button and stop it with the "Stop" button.

Idempotency: The "Start" button is disabled (logically) while the timer is running, preventing the creation of multiple simultaneous intervals.

Cleanup: The clearInterval() function is correctly used, and the interval ID is reset to ensure the process can be restarted.

ðŸ’» Setup and Usage
This project is a single-file application. No build tools or server are required.

Save the code: Save the provided HTML content as an .html file (e.g., index.html).

Open in Browser: Double-click the file to open it in any web browser.

Interact:

Click the Start button to begin the background color change every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

Click the Stop button to halt the process.

ðŸ§  Key JavaScript Concepts Demonstrated
This project is an excellent example of:

setInterval() and clearInterval(): Proper initiation and termination of a repeating timer.

Function Scope: Using the outer-scoped let intervalId to allow two separate functions (startChangingColor and stopChangingColor) to share and manage the timer ID.

DOM Manipulation: Changing the inline style of the document.body to update the background color.

Event Listeners: Attaching functions to button click events (.addEventListener('click', ...)).

Hexadecimal Logic: Generating random numbers to construct a valid hexadecimal color string.
